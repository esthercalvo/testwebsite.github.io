======
I am a PhD Candidate at the Department of Political Science, Lund University. Prior to coming to Lund, I taught in the Department of Social Sciences at the University of the Philippines Los Ba√±os from 2014 to 2020. My main research interests include computational text analysis, legislative behavior and speech-making, and party competition.
