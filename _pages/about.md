======
I am a PhD Candidate at the Department of Political Science, Lund University. I obtained my B.A. (cum laude) and M.A. (with merit) in Political Science from the University of the Philippines Diliman and the Central European University Budapest respectively. Prior to coming to Lund, I taught in the Department of Social Sciences at the University of the Philippines Los Baños from 2014 to 2020. My main research interests include computational text analysis, legislative behavior and speech-making, and party competition.
